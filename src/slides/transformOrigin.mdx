# We need to talk about `transform-origin`

<Row>
  <Column>
    `transform-origin` has a default value of `50% 50%` which will not have the effect I wanted

    $$
      x_t = \frac{x}{1-s}
    $$

    $$ x_t = $$ the required transform-origin offset (in pixels) to make a scaling operation appear to originate from a desired point.
    
    $$ x = $$ the actual desired visual pixel offset
    
    $$ s = $$ the scale factor applied to the element (e.g., from a CSS transform: scale(s)).
