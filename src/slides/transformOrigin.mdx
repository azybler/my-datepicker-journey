# We need to talk about `transform-origin`

<Row>
  <Column>
  `transform-origin` has a default value of `50% 50%` which will not have the effect I wanted.

    $$
      p_t = p \frac{1}{1-s}
    $$

    $$ p_t = $$ transform-origin offset we're trying to calculate.
    
    $$ p = $$ actual pixel offset we wanted.
    
    $$ s = $$ the scale we're transforming it to.
