# My First attempt

My attempt to replicate it in JavaScript!

<Row>
  <Column>
    <YouTube videoId="q46aMgiOkUA" />
  </Column>
  <Column>
    <ClickReveal>
      The result? Not very well. It stutters, and it's shaky

      I believe I used some JavaScript animation library, I basically have to calculate the font size, the position etc

      I think I have lost the source code, it was 18 years ago.

      But it sucks, so who cares
    </ClickReveal>
  </Column>
</Row>
